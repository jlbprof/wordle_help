I was able to get a large english word list from their project.

## Finding an opening word

For a long time I used GREAT as my opening word and I had good success with that.  But is there a better word?

./wordle_opening_word.pl CA2 CE2 CI2 CO2 CU1 CS1 CT1 CR1 CL1

## Using wordle_help.pl

    usage: wordle_help [clues]
        clues: AX3, character X is at position 3
            NX3, character X is present but NOT at position 3
            XX,  character X is NOT present
        Positions are 1 based

## Accumulated results
